# Import from TViso

[TViso](https://es.tviso.com) is a web service that helps you track movies and tv shows. This application (Media Kraken) has been implemented as a replacement for TViso, given that [they announced](https://blog.tviso.com/tenemos-que-hablar) their intention to close or sell the service.

You can export your data from TViso [here](https://es.tviso.com/my-settings/export-collection) (choose json format).
