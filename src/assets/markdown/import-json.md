# Import from JSON

If you are not able to import your data with the other options, you can upload a JSON file. This can be useful to take your data with you when you <button data-trigger="show-markdown:application-storage" type="button" class="link">are using browser storage</button>. You can also adapt data from other sources, consult the required format [here](%url%).

*Pro tip: If you want to inspect the format of a JSON file, you can use this awesome [JSON Online Editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org).*
