# How can I log in?

## Login with Solid

If you want to keep your data and access it from other devices, you should probably login with Solid. Solid is a decentralized storage protocol that decouples applications from data.

In order to log in with Solid, you need to own a Solid POD and give permissions to this application so that it can read and write data. You can get a POD [here](https://solid.inrupt.com/get-a-solid-pod).

## Login Offline

If you only want to try the app or you don't care about losing your data, you should probably login Offline. Offline mode will store your data in localStorage so it won't be accessible from other devices and it may get removed if you clear the history in your browser (or use private mode).
