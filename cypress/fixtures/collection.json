When he presses a mysteriously phallic protuberance that appears on one wall, a pink toothbrush materializes from nowhere, clattering to the floor and setting in motion a genuinely bizarre chain of events. Soon the imprisoned man is engaged in absurd and hilarious attempts to escape the gleaming room, releasing random objects from the walls, creating a life sized mouse trap game in which a rope, a toilet plunger and an earthenware jug full of sushi might just be the keys to his escape. Meanwhile, in a dusty town, a green masked Mexican wrestler known as Escargot Man prepares for an important match.","datePublished":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2009-09-12T00:00:00.000Z"},"sameAs":["https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/42430","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410261"],"purl:created":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2020-06-09T17:12:29.681Z"},"purl:modified":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2020-06-09T17:12:29.683Z"},"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3hWWrQ86GJMb0JQEY6JhHPnveW4.jpg","@id":"browser-storage://movies/symbol-2009","actions":[{"@type":"WatchAction","purl:created":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2020-06-09T17:12:29.452Z"},"@id":"browser-storage://movies/symbol-2009#e1cca084-9a2e-4f48-8f26-216e21042e80"}]},{"@context":{"@vocab":"https://schema.org/","purl":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","actions":{"@reverse":"object"}},"@type":"Movie","name":"Jaws","description":"When an insatiable great white shark terrorizes the townspeople of Amity Island, the police chief, an oceanographer and a grizzled shark hunter seek to destroy the blood-thirsty beast.","datePublished":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"1975-06-18T00:00:00.000Z"},"sameAs":["https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/578","https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195"],"purl:created":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2020-06-09T17:13:45.167Z"},"purl:modified":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime","@value":"2020-06-09T17:13:45.169Z"},"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/s2xcqSFfT6F7ZXHxowjxfG0yisT.jpg","@id":"browser-storage://movies/jaws-1975","actions":[]}]
